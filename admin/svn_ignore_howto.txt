Place the filenames/patterns (wildcard only) in a .svnignore file in the
directory, then

svn propset svn:ignore -F .svnignore .

The command above has to be repeated after each new edit of .svnignore

Alternately, use

svn propedit svn:ignore .

This will open .svnignore in your text editor, and once you save it, properties
get set

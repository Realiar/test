  Export Restriction Disclaimer:
  We believe that CWP/SU: Seismic Un*x is a low technology product that does
  not appear on the Department of Commerce CCL list of restricted exports.
  Accordingly, we believe that our product meets the qualifications of
  an ECCN (export control classification number) of EAR99 and we believe
  it fits the qualifications of NRR (no restrictions required), and
  is thus not subject to export restrictions of any variety.

YXTOXY - Compute a regularly-sampled, monotonically increasing function x(y)
	from a regularly-sampled, monotonically increasing function y(x) by
	inverse linear interpolation.

yxtoxy		compute a regularly sampled function x(y) from a regularly
		sampled, monotonically increasing function y(x)

******************************************************************************
Function Prototype:
void yxtoxy (int nx, float dx, float fx, float y[], 
	int ny, float dy, float fy, float xylo, float xyhi, float x[]);

******************************************************************************
Input:
nx		number of samples of y(x)
dx		x sampling interval; dx>0.0 is required
fx		first x
y		array[nx] of y(x) values; y[0] < y[1] < ... < y[nx-1] required
ny		number of samples of x(y)
dy		y sampling interval; dy>0.0 is required
fy		first y
xylo		x value assigned to x(y) when y is less than smallest y(x)
xyhi		x value assigned to x(y) when y is greater than largest y(x)

Output:
x		array[ny] of x(y) values

******************************************************************************
 Notes:
 User must ensure that:
 (1) dx>0.0 && dy>0.0
 (2) y[0] < y[1] < ... < y[nx-1] */

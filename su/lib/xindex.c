  Export Restriction Disclaimer:
  We believe that CWP/SU: Seismic Un*x is a low technology product that does
  not appear on the Department of Commerce CCL list of restricted exports.
  Accordingly, we believe that our product meets the qualifications of
  an ECCN (export control classification number) of EAR99 and we believe
  it fits the qualifications of NRR (no restrictions required), and
  is thus not subject to export restrictions of any variety.

XINDEX - determine index of x with respect to an array of x values

xindex		determine index of x with respect to an array of x values

******************************************************************************
Input:
nx		number of x values in array ax
ax		array[nx] of monotonically increasing or decreasing x values
x		the value for which index is to be determined
index		index determined previously (used to begin search)

Output:
index		for monotonically increasing ax values, the largest index
		for which ax[index]<=x, except index=0 if ax[0]>x;
		for monotonically decreasing ax values, the largest index
		for which ax[index]>=x, except index=0 if ax[0]<x

******************************************************************************
Notes:
This function is designed to be particularly efficient when called
repeatedly for slightly changing x values; in such cases, the index 
returned from one call should be used in the next.

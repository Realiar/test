The Users tutorials demonstrate how to use the Madagascar framework to create, process and visualize data, and to create reproducible scripts for processing data.  The main goals of the Users tutorials are to learn about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the Madagascar framework,
    \item the RSF file format,
    \item the command line interface,
    \item how to interact with files on the command line,
    \item commonly used programs,
    \item how to make plots in Madagascar,
    \item how to make reproducible scripts,
    \item how to use SCons and Python,
    \item how to visualize your data.
\end{itemize}
By the end of this tutorial group you should be able to fully use all of Madagascar's built-in tools for data processing and scripting.  By using these tools, you'll be able to process data ranging from tens of megabytes to tens of terabytes in a reproducible fashion.

\caption{The number of iterations required for convergence for four model 
problems (with four forcing functions per model).
The grid sizes were $500^3$ and roughly 50 wavelengths were spanned in each 
direction. Five grid points were used for all PML discretizations, 
four planes were processed per panel, and the damping factors were all set to 
$7$.}

Directory with papers that are no longer reproducible. Papers may be taken out
of the grave and resurrected if their reproducibility problems are fixed. The
testing procedure is described at http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Automatic_Testing .
The initial cause of failure (when known) should be described in a 
REPRO_FAIL.txt file in each main paper directory.

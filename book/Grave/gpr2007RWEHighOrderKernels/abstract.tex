Riemannian wavefield extrapolation (RWE) is a technique for one-way
extrapolation of acoustic waves. RWE generalizes wavefield
extrapolation by downward continuation by considering coordinate
systems different from conventional Cartesian. Coordinate systems can
conform with the extrapolated wavefield, with the velocity model or
with the acquisition geometry.  
%
\par When coordinate systems conform with the propagated wavefield,
extrapolation can be done accurately using low-order kernels. However,
in complex media or in cases the coordinate systems do not conform
with the propagating wavefields, low order kernels are not accurate
enough and need to be replaced by more accurate, higher order
kernels. Since RWE is based on factorization of an acoustic
wave-equation, higher order kernels can be constructed using methods
analogous with the one employed for factorization of the acoustic
wave-equation in Cartesian coordinates. Thus, we can construct
space-domain finite-differences as well as mixed-domain techniques for
extrapolation.  
%
\par High-order RWE kernels improve the accuracy of extrapolation,
particularly when the Riemannian coordinate systems does not match
closely the general direction of wave propagation.

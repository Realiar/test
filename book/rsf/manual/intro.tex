Madagascar provides interfaces for programming in C and optionally in C++ and Fortran90, etc. The C API is installed automatically during the installation of the Madagascar package. The other interfaces should be installed separately, if necessary, as explained in the installation guide.Programming using a language for which an API (Applications Programming Interface) is provided by Madagascar allows the user to operate on RSF files and also use some predefined functions from the RSF library. These library files are located in the directories \texttt{api} and \texttt{build/api} in the source directory. A guide to Madagascar programming interface can be found at the \href{http://www.reproducibility.org/wiki/Guide_to_madagascar_API}{Madagascar website}

Local slopes of seismic events carry complete information about the
structure of the subsurface. This information is sufficient for
accomplishing all time-domain imaging tasks, without the need to
estimate or know the seismic velocity model. We develop a
velocity-independent $\tau$-$p$ imaging approach to perform moveout
correction in \old{2D} horizontally-layered VTI media. The effective
and interval anisotropic parameters turn into data attributes through
the use of slopes and become directly mappable to the zero-slope
traveltime. The $\tau$-$p$ transform is the natural domain for
anisotropy parameter estimation in layered media, because the phase
velocity is given explicitly in terms of $p$. Therefore, the
$\tau$-$p$ transform allows for reflection-traveltime modeling and
inversion that are simpler than traditional methods based on
Taylor-series expansions of traveltime in $t$-$X$ domain. Synthetic
and field data tests demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our
method.

------------------------------------------------------

1. Pre-requisites
===============
- RSF (http://rsf.sourceforge.net/) with Matlab API
	+ add $RSFROOT/lib to your Matlab startup.m file
- SPGL1 (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spgl1/)
	+ add path_to_SPGL1 to your Matlab startup.m file
- Sparco (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/sparco/)
	+ add path_to_Sparco to your Matlab startup.m file

IMPORTANT: do not forget to add these pieces of software in your
Matlab startup.m file!

2. Quickstart
===============

- In "Fig" folder, run

bash$ scons

at the terminal prompt.

- In the "geop" folder, run

bash$ scons lock

at the terminal prompt.

- In the "pareto" folder, run

bash$ scons lock

at the terminal prompt.

- In the folder where you found this README file, run

bash$ scons read

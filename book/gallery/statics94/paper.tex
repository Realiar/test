\begin{abstract}
  This model was created by Mike O'Brien under the supervision of Carl
  Regone at the Amoco Tulsa Technology Center in 1994, as part of a
  project to study methods for attacking statics in land data. The
  geology of the model is completely invented, not based on any
  specific play. It contains many different types of near-surface
  geology, generally representing geology thought to be responsible
  for statics. The model is 2D, purely acoustic, with a constant
  density. It was used in two internal Amoco reports but was never
  published externally by Amoco.

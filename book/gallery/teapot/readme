It has been a two years since we worked on these scripts at the 1st Madagascar
working workshop, but I wanted to write a readme file with what I remember.

Zomig is a post stack split step migration.  
Zomig1 was a rerun ot Zomig with more spatial padding.  This looks much better
       because space wrap was reduced.
angmig is Klokov style angle migration.
myangmig I belive this is an experiment modifying parameters in angmig

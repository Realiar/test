Wave mode separation\old{/} \new{and vector} decomposition \old{can be}\new{are} significantly more expensive
than wavefield extrapolation and \old{is}\new{are}
the computational bottleneck for elastic reverse-time migration (ERTM) in heterogeneous anisotropic media.
We express elastic wave mode separation and vector decomposition for anisotropic media as space-wavenumber-domain operations
 in the form of Fourier integral operators, and develop fast algorithms for their implementation
 using their low-rank approximations. \old{Synthetic examples of models of increasing complexity
 show}\new{Synthetic data generated from 2D and 3D models demonstrate} that these methods are \old{both} accurate and efficient.

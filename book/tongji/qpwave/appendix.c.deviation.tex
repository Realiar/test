\append{Deviation between phase normal and polarization direction of qP-waves in VTI media}

For VTI media,  \cite{dellinger.thesis} presents an expression of the deviation angle $\zeta$ between the phase normal
(with phase angle $\psi$) and the polarization direction of qP-waves, namely
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:devAngle}
\sin^2(\zeta)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{[(2s-1)t_{1}-t_{2}]\sqrt{t_{1}^2-t_{2}\chi}}{2(t_{2}\chi-{t_{1}}^2)},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s & =  \sin^2(\psi), \\
t_{1} & =  s(C_{33}+C_{11}-2C_{44})-C_{33}+C_{44} \\
      & =  s\rho[v_{p0}^2+(1+2\epsilon)v_{p0}^2-2v_{s0}^2]-\rho{v_{p0}^2}+\rho{v_{s0}^2}, \\
t_{2} & =  4s(s-1)\chi, \\
\chi & =  C_{13}+C_{44} \\ 
     & =  \rho\sqrt{(v_{p0}^2-v_{s0}^2)(v_{pn}^2-v_{s0}^2)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Equation~\ref{eq:devAngle} indicates that the deviation angle has a complicated nonlinear relation with anisotropic parameters 
and the phase angle. The relationship is rather lengthy and does not easily reveal the features caused by anisotropy.
 Hence we use an alternative expression under a weak anisotropy assumption \cite[]{rommel:1994, tsvankin:2001},
\begin{equation}
\zeta=\frac{[\delta+2(\epsilon-\delta)\sin^2{\psi}]\sin{2\psi}}{2(1-\frac{v_{s0}^2}{v_{p0}^2})}
\end{equation}
It appears that the deviation angle is mainly affected by the difference between $\epsilon$ and $\delta$,
 the magnitude of $\delta$ (when $\epsilon-\delta$ stays the same) and the ratio of vertical velocities of
 qP- and qS-wave, as well as the phase angle.

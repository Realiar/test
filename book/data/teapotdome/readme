Outline of directories in teapotdome:

MAIN tah PROCESSING
+++++++++++++++++++
$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/fetch
	scons in this directory will download data and run sfsegyread

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/geom
	basic fold plots and shot/group maps

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/vels
 	interpolate velocity (not used yet in later directories)

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahnmostack
	apply nmo and stack of the preprocessed gathers downloaded in the 
	../fetch directory.  This stack is compared to the stack created 
	using seismic unix, SU.  This directory also displays some of the 
	midpoint gathers from the processed gathers with and without nmo.
	A few of the unprocessed shot records dowloaded in the fetch 
	directory are displayed with and without nmo.  sftahsort is used
	to sort a few unprocessed midpoint gathers for comparison with 
	the processed midpoint gathers. 

        Perhaps the tahnmostack SConstruct whould be divided.  May move other 
	portions, like qc and preprocessint the npr3_field.rsf, into 
	another direcory.

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahsubset
	This directory extracts a subset of the data to test prestack 
	interpolation - the data is iline,xline,offset.  (sx,sy) and (gx,gy)
	are in the trace headers and can be used to compute offsetx, offsety.
	The 3D loading information can be read using:
	cd $RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/fetch
	scons 3dload.rsf
	# you can checkout trace header information using
	more fieldheaderattr.txt
	more npr3_gathers.thdr
	# useful processing information is in:
	scons processing.pdf
	
	The subset of the data extractes is about 400m inline, 400m xline and 
	all offsets.  This is approximately patch size Sacchi recommended if
	you write your own offset and time windows.


$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahscscale
	apply surface consistant scaling to npr3_field.rsf
	need to modify Mtahscale to only compute scalars and seperate
	pass apply the scalars.  I think this will scale to larger
	3D surveys

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/tahscplot
	
$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/nmostack
	seismic unix scripts to apply nmo and stack the prestack processed
	data.
	nmo and stack using sfnmo, sfstack to compare with sftahnmo and 
	sftahstack.

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/cmp_stack_tahstack
	make plots to compare sfnmo/sfstack to sftahnmo/sftahstack

$RSFSRC/book/data/teapotdome/Zomig
	extended splitstep migration.  Display zomig and contractor kirchhoff


I need to index other work previous done by Vladimir.

Cant12 directory contains the workflows used to process marine seismic Line 12
from the data set of the Canterbury Basin, New Zealand using Madagascar. Some
processing jobs required access to Ranger (32 GB of RAM and 16 cores per node)
at Texas Advanced Computing Center at UT. Therefore, some directories will 
have a job file beside the SConstruct file .

The list of sub directories with a brief description of the purpose of each

- SEGY     : To read SEGY files and create shot.rsf file.
- shot     : To pick sea floor time and create shot.rsf and shot0.rsf.
- cmp      : To sort SHOT gathers into CMP gathers.
- decon    : To apply predictive deconvolution; the result was not used in 
             other processing workflows.
- interp   : To interpolate shots using PWD method; the result was not used
             in other processing workflows.
- srme     : To predict surface related mutliple energy using the algorithm
             described in (Dragoset 1998).
- lpf      : To adaptively subtract the predicted mutliples using regularized 
             nonstationary regressions introduced by Fomel (2009)
- vel      : To automatically pick stacking velocities from demultipled data
- stk0     : To create nmostk.rsf and dmostk.rsf from cmp/cmp.rsf; CMPs before
             demultiple
- stk      : To create nmostk.rsf and dmostk.rsf after demultiple
- stkdemul : To apply poststack demultiple using SRME and regularized 
             nonstationary regressions.
- velcon   : To estimate migration velocities using both velocity continuation 
             (Fomel 2003) and path integral (Burnett and Fomel 2011) methods on
              diffraction data 
- mig      : To generate conventional migrated section and migrated 
             diffractions section using Kirchhoff migration in dip-angle 
             gather domain.

Here are a few tips on running on Stampede:

I donot think using "Fetch" is the approved way to load data onto stampede.
I suggest you transfer data to stampede from anopther computer:

scp filename username@stampede.tacc.utexas.edu:/path/to/your/project/dir
or
rsync filename username@stampede.tacc.utexas.edu:/path/to/your/project/dir
example - I loged onto fomel5 and ran:
rcp cant12.*.segy karls@stampede.tacc.utexas.edu:/work/02167/karls/data/cant12/fetch

Also globus-url-copy that may be used to achieve higher performance than 
the scp and scp programs when transferring large files between TACC clusters 
and the TACC archive (Ranch). During production, the scp and scp speeds 
between Stampede and Ranch average about 15MB/s, globus-url-copy speeds are 
about 125MB/s. These values vary with I/O and network traffic.  Try:

myproxy-logon -T -l <XSEDE_username> -s myproxy.xsede.org

This command will prompt for your XSEDE password. The proxy is valid for 12 
hours for all logins on the local machine. With globus-url-copy, you must 
include the name of the server and a full path to the file. The general syntax 
looks like:

globus-url-copy  gsiftp://<gridftp_server1>/<directory>|<file> \
          gsiftp://<gridftp_server2>/<directory>|<file>

The following command copies "directory1" from TACC's Stampede to TACC's Ranch system, renaming it to "directory2":

login1$ globus-url-copy -vb \
       gsiftp://data1.stampede.tacc.utexas.edu:2119/`pwd`/directory1/ \
       gsiftp://gridftp1.ranch.tacc.utexas.edu:2119/home/00000/johndoe/directory2/
I ran:
globus-url-copy -vb  \
       gsiftp:/work/02167/karls/data/cant12/fetch \
       gsiftp://gridftp1.ranch.tacc.utexas.edu:/home3/02167/karls/data/cant12/fetch
and got "command not found"

time scp /work/02167/karls/data/cant12/fetch/*  karls@ranch.tacc.utexas.edu:/home3/02167/karls/data/cant12/fetch
takes 2m25s
rsync /work/02167/karls/data/cant12/fetch/*  karls@ranch.tacc.utexas.edu:/home3/02167/karls/data/cant12/fetch
after the scp took 1m45s

I cd into SEGY and
sbatch segy.job
to show the queue:
showq -u karls

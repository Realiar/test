This file describes the procedure for re-compiling the extended abstract 
entitled "Shortest path ray tracing on parallel GPU devices" including 
re-computing all figures contained therein.  

Pre-requisites for building the manuscript:

1) Madagascar software package has been installed and all user-submitted 
   codes have been compiled and installed.

2) An up-to-date LaTeX distribution has been installed.

3) Our manuscript relies on the SEGTeX package for geophysical
   publications (http://www.ahay.org/wiki/SEGTeX).

To build the extended abstract:

1) Execute the command 'sftour scons lock' to initiate the computation 
   of the necessary figures contained in the manuscript.  

2) Execute the command 'scons segabs_graphrayt.pdf' to compile the pdf 
   version of the manuscript

The compiled manuscript can be found in the file segabs_graphrayt.pdf

\begin{abstract}
Wave equation migration velocity analysis (WEMVA) and WEMVA-like
approaches to Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) avoid the classic
cycle-skipping pitfall of FWI by literal data fit, using extended
models with non-physical degrees of freedom. This algorithm
design poses the obvious question: is it really possible to fit data
with wrong velocities? A theoretical answer is available in the WEMVA,
that is, linearized modeling, context. This paper uses the shot-record
extension to illustrate the how a ray-theoretic criterion (sharing
receiver rays) predicts correctly when data derived from one velocity
model may be accurately fit witn another.

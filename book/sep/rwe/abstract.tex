Riemannian spaces are described by 
non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.
We generalize one-way wavefield extrapolation to 
semi-orthogonal Riemannian coordinate systems, that 
include, but are not limited to, ray coordinate systems.
We obtain a one-way wavefield extrapolation method
which can be used for waves propagating in arbitrary
directions, in contrast 
\uline{to}
\sout{with}
downward continuation
which is used for waves propagating mainly
in the vertical direction.
Ray coordinate systems can be initiated 
\uline{in many different ways, for example}
\sout{either} 
from point sources, or from plane waves incident at various angles.
Since wavefield propagation happens mostly along the
extrapolation direction, we can use inexpensive
finite-difference or mixed-domain 
extrapolators to achieve high angle accuracy.
The main applications of our method include imaging
of steeply dipping or overturning reflections.

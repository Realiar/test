In the previous chapter I showed how waves in anisotropic
two-dimensional media can display such phenomena as
large amplitude variations,
cusps,
and anomalous polarizations.
Although such things are certainly possible,
we also know that geophysics got along pretty well assuming P
waves were isotropic or at worst elliptically anisotropic for a long time.
So we can hope that the sorts of media we are likely to
encounter in the real Earth
are usually not too far removed from isotropy.
From the examples in the previous chapter,
we might then feel justified in expecting
that we can usually count on having waves that
at least approximately fit the standard isotropic P, SV, and SH
designations.

In this chapter we show that while the two-dimensional story is
complete as far as it goes,
it is not a good preview of what happens in three dimensions.

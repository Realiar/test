I owe my familiarity with the asymptotic inversion theory to Sergey
Goldin. A short discussion with Martin Tygel helped me better
understand the true-amplitude migration concept.

I thank Jon Claerbout for helpful discussions and the sponsors of the Stanford
Exploration Project for the financial support of this work. Comments
  from three anonymous reviewers helped to improve the paper.

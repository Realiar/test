This directory contains a test suite and some examples.

gmake all----show everything one by one
gmake alltest----show every test one by one
gamke alldemo----show every demo one by one
gmake allprog----run every sampling program one by one

Each of the files beginning "TEST" is meant to test something.
It should be pretty obvious if something is wrong. Some of them
will print out text on your screen pointing out what to look for.
(If none of them do, then you've got a problem with your dev.message
routine.) 

gmake TEST_*.tube----show TEST_*

Demo files are meant to show what sort of nice pictures you can make
with vplot. 

gmake DEMO_*.tube----show DEMO_*
gmake demo*.tube----show demo_*.v

Programs:

The program Font.c produces pldb-format files which display the contents
of a font. For each glyph in a font the corresponding glyph in font 0
is shown (small), along with the glyph's index. A ``?'' in a box is
a special error symbol which indicates that the desired glyph is not
defined. This error glyph is glyph number 30 in font 0.

The program rastest.c must be linked with -lvplot, and the output of it
can be piped into any pen filter. It produces an interesting color raster
moire pattern (it may take a while to come out if you're using genraster).
This program also serves as an example of how to use vplotlib from a C program.

Other example C and FORTRAN programs are:

ellips.f, libvplot_example.c, polytest.c

You'll have to edit the makefile to call the appropriate pen filter.

The programs here are bad examples in that they implicitly use hardwired
magic numbers, without basing them off of the defined values in vplot.h.
The metafiles in this directory are also in raw integer Vplot units, not
inches or centimeters. These, however, are easy to convert using plas (if
needed) and pldb -i.

GRIDPP Unit Test 2
test of grid load from file, float and double
float case:

before read:
Grid axis list (non-defaults only)

after read:
Grid axis list (non-defaults only)
Axis structure, single precision: 
  number of points = 11
  step             = 0.1
  origin           = -0.5
  axis number      = 1
Axis structure, single precision: 
  number of points = 21
  step             = 0.1
  origin           = -1
  axis number      = 2
Axis structure, single precision: 
  number of points = 41
  step             = 0.1
  origin           = -2
  axis number      = 3

double case:

before read:
Grid axis list (non-defaults only)

after read:
Grid axis list (non-defaults only)
Axis structure, double precision: 
  number of points = 11
  step             = 0.1
  origin           = -0.5
  axis number      = 1
Axis structure, double precision: 
  number of points = 21
  step             = 0.1
  origin           = -1
  axis number      = 2
Axis structure, double precision: 
  number of points = 41
  step             = 0.1
  origin           = -2
  axis number      = 3
